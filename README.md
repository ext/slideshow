## Slideshow

Slideshow is a kiosk-style application for showing text, image and video in a continious loop on monitors and projectors. Content is edited and updated directly in using a webgui. The application is split into two packages, a backend and a frontend. The backend is written in C++ and OpenGL and the frontend using python. Currently the frontend is very GNU/Linux specific and will not run on any other platform but is meant to be as platform independent as possible, as long as it handles OpenGL.
