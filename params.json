{"name":"Slideshow","body":"### Slideshow.\r\n\r\nSlideshow is a kiosk-style application for showing text, image and video in a loop on monitors and projectors. It is not meant for situations where interactive control is required, but when the content is continuously looping for a long time. The content is updated through a webgui. The application is split into two packages, the backend and frontend. The backend is written in C++ and OpenGL and the frontend uses python. Currently the frontend is very GNU/Linux specific and will not run on any other platform but is however meant to be as platform independent as possible, as long as it handles OpenGL.","tagline":"","google":"UA-1375886-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
